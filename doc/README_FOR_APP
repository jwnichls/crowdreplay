TODO:

* Capistrano deployment
   - create and import app into github
   - create the appropriate directories and configuration on server
* omniauth twitter for recorder tokens
* Build recording interface in rails that fills in a database table
* Build Java recorder that runs as daemon, reads table, and runs all requested recorders
* Slightly nicer UI for navigating around the application
* Record the actual tweets into a file instead of the database (just store basic meta-data in the database)
   - Probably store the tweets in per minute files
